# MyScheduler
The RTOS Scheduler is a high-performance task management system designed to optimize system efficiency and resource utilization. It effectively organizes, prioritizes, and manages tasks in real time, ensuring seamless execution while adhering to critical constraints such as response time and tolerance limits.

Key Features:
Task Prioritization and Management:
  * Dynamically schedules tasks based on priority, deadlines, and system demands.
  * Prevents resource conflicts and ensures real-time responsiveness.

Low Power Mode Integration:
  * Detects idle states and transitions the system to low-power mode to conserve energy.
  * Rapidly resumes normal operation when new tasks arrive, maintaining minimal latency.

Tolerance and Response Time Optimization:
  * Implements mechanisms to avoid tolerance violations and response time delays.
  * Guarantees predictable and deterministic task execution, crucial for real-time applications.

Scalability and Flexibility:
  * Adapts to various workloads, making it suitable for embedded systems, IoT devices, and critical real-time applications.
  * Supports preemptive and cooperative multitasking modes to meet diverse system requirements.

The RTOS Scheduler ensures a balanced approach to performance, power efficiency, and reliability, making it a robust solution for modern real-time systems.
